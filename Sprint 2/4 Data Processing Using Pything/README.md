- **My Challenge: Extra Assessment**: *Netflix App*  - Build your own Netflix movie system using what you have learned so far. Use File I/O to load in the movies into your app. Begin by asking the user to login to your system (if they don't have the correct password), then give the approprate message.) Once they are logged in, Suggest a Movie to watch but also show Genres that they can watch. Use your creativity. **NOTE:** 
	-  Use File I/O (userPasswords.csv, movies.json)
		-  Movies should have (name, duration, genre, rating)
	-  Ask user to login (verify info correct(
	-  Once logged in, suggest movie from loaded movies
	-  Show Genres for user to choose
	-  Simply simulate watching. Display("watching movie Avatar"). 
	-  After done watching the movie, make a suggestion based on the previous genre or ask the user to choose a genre or quit.
